# DR001: Adoption of an off-the-shelf Code of Conduct

Date: 2023-01-03

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need an explicit and documented code of conduct to support people collaborating with us on our projects.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the Contributor Covenant v2.1 as our code of conduct. 

## Consequences

This prevents us from needing to write one from scratch, but does commit the team to:

- discussing the implications of adopting the code of conduct
- thoroughly reading the [enforcement guidelines](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/#enforcement-guidelines) section of the code
- setting up and monitoring an enforcement contact method.
